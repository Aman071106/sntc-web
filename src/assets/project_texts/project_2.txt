SAE Efficycle '24
Efficycle is a versatile vehicle powered by both manual pedaling and battery-based electric power. Users can pedal manually without battery backup and even charge the vehicle while pedaling, making Efficycle environmentally friendly and less labor-intensive than traditional bicycles. Its unique tadpole configuration, featuring two front wheels and one rear wheel, provides enhanced stability on mountainous terrains compared to the conventional delta configuration.
